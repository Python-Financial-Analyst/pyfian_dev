    "## Bullet Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A bullet bond is a type of fixed-income security with a very straightforward repayment structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "1. **No Amortization**  \n",
    "   - The issuer does not repay any portion of the principal during the life of the bond.  \n",
    "   - Only interest (coupon) payments are made periodically (e.g., semi-annual or annual).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Principal Repaid at Maturity**  \n",
    "   - The entire face value (principal) is repaid in one \"bullet\" payment at the end of the bond’s term.  \n",
    "   - This makes it different from amortizing bonds (like many mortgages), where principal is gradually repaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Predictable Cash Flow**  \n",
    "   - Investors receive regular coupon payments and then a large lump sum at maturity.  \n",
    "   - This makes bullet bonds relatively simple to understand and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **For issuers**: Lower cash outflow during the life of the bond since they don’t repay principal until maturity.  \n",
    "- **For investors**: Predictable stream of income plus a known lump-sum repayment date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks\n",
    "- **Credit risk**: Since principal repayment is concentrated at the end, investors bear the risk that the issuer might default before maturity.  \n",
    "- **Refinancing risk for issuers**: They must have sufficient liquidity or refinancing ability to repay the lump sum when due.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Examples\n",
    "- Many **corporate bonds** and **sovereign bonds** are structured as bullet bonds.  \n",
    "- Eurobonds and U.S. Treasury notes/bonds are classic examples.\n",

A discount curve provides the discount factors needed to compute these present values, accounting for the time value of money and interest rate risk. Each cash flow is multiplied by the discount factor corresponding to its payment time, and the sum of these discounted cash flows gives the bond's price.\n",
