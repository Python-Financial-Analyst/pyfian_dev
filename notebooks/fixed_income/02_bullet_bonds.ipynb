    "\n",
    "### What is Convexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convexity measures the curvature in the relationship between a bond's price and its yield, capturing the non-linear sensitivity of the bond price to changes in interest rates. While duration provides a linear approximation of price changes, convexity accounts for the fact that the price-yield relationship is curved, improving the accuracy of price change predictions, especially for larger yield shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, convexity is defined as the second derivative of the bond price with respect to the yield, scaled by the bond price:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\frac{1}{P} \\frac{d^2P}{dy^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ( P ) is the bond price, and ( y ) is the yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convexity of a Zero Coupon Bond\n",
    "\n",
    "For a zero coupon bond with price ( Z(t,T) = e^{-r (T-t)} ), where ( r ) is the interest rate and ( T-t ) is the time to maturity, we can calculate the convexity as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dZ}{dr} = -(T-t) e^{-r (T-t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d^2Z}{dr^2} = (T-t)^2 e^{-r (T-t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\frac{1}{Z(t,T)} \\frac{d^2Z}{dr^2} = \\frac{(T-t)^2 e^{-r (T-t)}}{e^{-r (T-t)}} = (T-t)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for a zero coupon bond, the convexity is the square of the time to maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convexity for a Coupon-Bearing Bond\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a bond with price:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{c/2}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^j} + \\frac{100}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ( c ) is the annual coupon rate, ( y ) is the yield, and ( n ) is the number of periods. The convexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\frac{1}{P} \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{j (j+1) (c/2)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^j} + \\frac{n (n+1) (100)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{n+2}} $$\n",

    "$$ C_\\pi = \\sum_i w_i C_i $$\n",

    "where ( $w_i = \\frac{N_i P_i}{\\Pi}$ ), ( $N_i$ ) is the number of bonds, ( $P_i$ ) is the price of bond ( $i $), and ( $\\Pi$ ) is the total portfolio value."
