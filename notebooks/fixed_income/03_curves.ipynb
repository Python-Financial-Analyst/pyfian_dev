    "\n",
    "A bond yield curve represents the yields of bonds with different maturities, providing insight into how investors value short-term versus long-term debt. The shape of the curve is closely tied to macroeconomic conditions and market expectations.\n",
    "For instance, an upward-sloping yield curve often signals economic growth: investors prefer short-term bonds (or cash equivalents) to fund projects and investments, pushing up short-term demand and yields. Conversely, an inverted yield curve may indicate economic uncertainty or a potential slowdown, as investors seek the safety of longer-term bonds, driving their yields lower relative to short-term bonds.\n",
    "Different types of curves—such as spot curves, forward curves, and par curves—highlight various aspects of bond pricing and interest rate expectations. By analyzing these curves, investors and policymakers gain valuable insights into market sentiment and the broader economic outlook. Here are some examples of curves we can look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Spread**: Difference in yield between bonds of similar maturity but different credit quality, typically corporate vs. Treasury.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward Curve**: Shows forward rates, implied future interest rates for specific periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpolated Curve**: Yields estimated between observed maturities using interpolation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Par Curve**: Coupon rates for bonds priced at par value across maturities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spot Curve**: Yields on zero-coupon bonds for different maturities.  "

    "\n",
    "A flat yield curve occurs when short-term and long-term bond yields are nearly the same. This shape suggests uncertainty in the economy: investors do not strongly prefer one maturity over another, and the market is signaling that future growth and inflation expectations are unclear. Flat curves often appear during transitions in the business cycle, such as when the economy is shifting from expansion to slowdown."
