    "Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are short-term government securities, typically issued with maturities ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. They are sold at a discount to their face value and redeemed at par, so investors earn a return from the difference between purchase price and face value rather than periodic interest payments. T-Bills are highly liquid and considered very low-risk, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. They are commonly used for short-term cash management by investors, corporations, and governments. Additionally, in many countries, the interest income from T-Bills is exempt from state and local taxes, making them a safe and tax-efficient investment.\n",

    "Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short- to medium-term time deposits issued by banks that pay a fixed interest rate over a specified period. Unlike Treasury Bills, CDs do pay interest (coupon) periodically or at maturity, depending on the terms. They are considered low-risk investments, typically insured up to certain limits in many countries, and are sold at face value rather than at a discount. The investor agrees to leave the funds deposited for a fixed term, and early withdrawal may result in penalties. CDs can have different maturities, ranging from a few weeks to several years, and their yield depends on the interest rate environment and the issuing bank’s creditworthiness."

They typically have maturities ranging from a few days up to 270 days and are sold at a discount, meaning the issuer repays the face value at maturity. Because they are unsecured, only financially strong companies with high credit ratings can issue them at favorable rates. Commercial papers are a common tool for efficient, short-term corporate financing."

It represents a promise that the bank will pay a specified amount to the holder at a future date, typically used in international trade to finance the import or export of goods. Since the payment is backed by a bank, it carries low risk and can be traded in the money market, providing liquidity to both businesses and investors."
