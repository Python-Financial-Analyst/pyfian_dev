    "Money market instruments (MMIs) are short-term debt securities, typically maturing in less than one year, used for liquidity management and low-risk investing. Examples include Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper, Certificates of Deposit, and Bankers’ Acceptances. Bonds, on the other hand, are long-term debt instruments with maturities often exceeding one year, paying periodic interest (coupons) and primarily used for long-term financing or investment.

    "Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are short-term government securities, typically issued with maturities ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. They are sold at a discount to their face value and redeemed at par, so investors earn a return from the difference between purchase price and face value rather than periodic interest payments. T-Bills are highly liquid and considered very low-risk, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. They are commonly used for short-term cash management by investors, corporations, and governments. Additionally, in many countries, the interest income from T-Bills is exempt from state and local taxes, making them a safe and tax-efficient investment.\n",

    "Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short- to medium-term time deposits issued by banks that pay a fixed interest rate over a specified period. Unlike Treasury Bills, CDs do pay interest (coupon) periodically or at maturity, depending on the terms. They are considered low-risk investments, typically insured up to certain limits in many countries, and are sold at face value rather than at a discount. The investor agrees to leave the funds deposited for a fixed term, and early withdrawal may result in penalties. CDs can have different maturities, ranging from a few weeks to several years, and their yield depends on the interest rate environment and the issuing bank’s creditworthiness."

They typically have maturities ranging from a few days up to 270 days and are sold at a discount, meaning the issuer repays the face value at maturity. Because they are unsecured, only financially strong companies with high credit ratings can issue them at favorable rates.

    "A Bankers’ Acceptance is a short-term, negotiable financial instrument issued by a company but guaranteed by a bank. It represents a promise that the bank will pay a specified amount to the holder at a future date, typically used in international trade to finance the import or export of goods. Since the payment is backed by a bank, it carries low risk and can be traded in the money market, providing liquidity to both businesses and investors."

Essentially, it functions as a collateralized loan: the seller gets immediate cash, and the buyer earns interest through the repurchase price. Repos are widely used in money markets to manage short-term liquidity and fund investments safely."
