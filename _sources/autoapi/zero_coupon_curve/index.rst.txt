   ZeroCouponCurve represents a yield curve for zero-coupon rates at different maturities.

   :param zero_rates: Dictionary mapping maturities (in years) to zero-coupon rates (as decimals).
   :type zero_rates: dict
   :param curve_date: Date of the curve.
   :type curve_date: str or datetime-like
   :param day_count_convention: Day count convention to use (default is None). If None, "actual/365" will be used.
   :type day_count_convention: str or DayCountBase, optional
   :param yield_calculation_convention: Yield calculation convention to use (default is None).
                                        Supported conventions: "Annual", "BEY", "Continuous". If None, "Annual" will be used.
   :type yield_calculation_convention: str, optional

      :type:  pyfian.utils.day_count.DayCountBase


   .. py:attribute:: yield_calculation_convention
      :type:  str
      :value: 'Annual'

   .. py:attribute:: maturities


   .. py:method:: as_dict()

      Convert the curve to a dictionary.



   .. py:method:: _prepare_zero_rates(zero_rates)

      Prepare zero rates for the curve sorted by time and with time fractions.



   .. py:method:: discount_t(t: float, spread: float = 0) -> float

      Discount a cash flow by time t (in years).

      The formula used is:

      .. math:: PV = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{t}}

      where:

      - :math:`PV` is the present value
      - :math:`r` is the annual effective rate (AER) for the period
      - :math:`t` is the time in years

      :param t: Time in years to discount.
      :type t: float
      :param spread: Spread to add to the discount rate.
      :type spread: float

      :returns: Present value of the cash flow.
      :rtype: float



   .. py:method:: discount_to_rate(discount_factor: float, t: float, spread: float, yield_calculation_convention: Optional[str] = None) -> float

      Convert a discount factor for a period t to a rate.

      The formula used is:

      .. math::

          r = (\frac{1}{D(t)})^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1 - s

      where:
      - D(t) is the discount factor at time t
      - r is the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) for the period
      - s is the spread

      :param discount_factor: Discount factor.
      :type discount_factor: float
      :param t: Time in years.
      :type t: float
      :param spread: Spread to subtract from the yield to get a Risk Free rate. Defaults to 0.
      :type spread: float, optional

      :returns: Annual effective rate (AER).
      :rtype: float



   .. py:method:: discount_date(date: Union[str, pandas.Timestamp], spread: float = 0) -> float

      Discount a cash flow to a specific date.

      The spread is added to the yield in the original curve.

      :param date: Date to discount to.
      :type date: Union[str, pd.Timestamp]
      :param spread: Spread to add to the discount rate.
      :type spread: float

      :returns: Present value of the cash flow.
      :rtype: float



   .. py:method:: get_rate(t: float, yield_calculation_convention: Optional[str] = None, spread: float = 0) -> float

      Get the rate for a cash flow by time t (in years).

      The spread is added to the yield in the original curve.

      yield_calculation_convention can be used to transform the yield to different conventions.

      :param t: Time in years to discount.
      :type t: float
      :param spread: Spread to add to the discount rate.
      :type spread: float
      :param yield_calculation_convention: Yield calculation convention to use (default is None).
      :type yield_calculation_convention: Optional[str]

      :returns: Rate for the cash flow.
      :rtype: float



   .. py:method:: date_rate(date: Union[str, pandas.Timestamp], yield_calculation_convention: Optional[str] = None, spread: float = 0) -> float

      Get the rate for a cash flow by date.

      The spread is added to the yield in the original curve.

      yield_calculation_convention can be used to transform the yield to different conventions.

      :param date: Date to get the rate for.
      :type date: Union[str, pd.Timestamp]
      :param yield_calculation_convention: Yield calculation convention to use (default is None).
      :type yield_calculation_convention: Optional[str]
      :param spread: Spread to add to the rate.
      :type spread: float

      :returns: Rate for the cash flow.
      :rtype: float



   .. py:method:: _get_t(t: float, spread: float = 0) -> float

      Get the rate for a cash flow by time t (in years).

      The spread is added to the yield in the original curve.

      :param t: Time in years to discount.
      :type t: float
      :param spread: Spread to add to the discount rate.
      :type spread: float

      :returns: Rate for the cash flow.
      :rtype: float

   Bases: :py:obj:`ZeroCouponCurve`


   ZeroCouponCurveByDate is a subclass of ZeroCouponCurve that allows for the input of zero rates as a function of dates.
