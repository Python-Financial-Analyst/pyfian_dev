.. py:function:: present_value_annuity(payment: float, rate: float, periods: int) -> float

   Calculate the present value of a fixed annuity.

   The present value of a fixed annuity is given by:

   .. math::
       PV = P \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}

   where:
       - :math:`PV` is the present value
       - :math:`P` is the payment per period
       - :math:`r` is the interest rate per period
       - :math:`n` is the total number of periods

   :param payment: The fixed payment amount per period.
   :type payment: float
   :param rate: The interest rate per period (as a decimal).
   :type rate: float
   :param periods: The total number of periods.
   :type periods: int

   :returns: Present value of the fixed annuity.
   :rtype: float

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> present_value_annuity(100, 0.05, 10)

.. py:function:: present_value_growing_annuity(payment: float, rate: float, growth: float, periods: int) -> float

   Calculate the present value of a growing annuity.

   :param payment: The initial payment amount per period.
   :type payment: float
   :param rate: The interest rate per period (as a decimal).
   :type rate: float
   :param growth: The growth rate of the payments (as a decimal).
   :type growth: float
   :param periods: The total number of periods.
   :type periods: int

   :returns: Present value of the growing annuity.
   :rtype: float

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> present_value_growing_annuity(100, 0.05, 0.02, 10)
   838.8105652432927
   >>> present_value_growing_annuity(100, 0.05, 0.05, 10)

.. py:function:: present_value_two_stage_annuity(payment: float, rate1: float, rate2: float, periods1: int, periods2: int) -> float

   Calculate the present value of a two-stage annuity.

   :param payment: The fixed payment amount per period.
   :type payment: float
   :param rate1: Interest rate for the first stage (as a decimal).
   :type rate1: float
   :param rate2: Interest rate for the second stage (as a decimal).
   :type rate2: float
   :param periods1: Number of periods in the first stage.
   :type periods1: int
   :param periods2: Number of periods in the second stage.
   :type periods2: int

   :returns: Present value of the two-stage annuity.
   :rtype: float

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> present_value_two_stage_annuity(100, 0.05, 0.06, 5, 5)
