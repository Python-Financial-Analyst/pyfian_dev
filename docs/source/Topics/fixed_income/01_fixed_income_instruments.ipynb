    "Fixed income instruments, such as bonds, are debt securities that provide investors with regular interest payments and the return of principal at maturity. The core structure of a bond includes the face or par value (the amount repaid at maturity), the coupon rate (the interest paid to bondholders), the maturity date (when the principal is repaid), and the payment frequency (how often interest is paid). Bonds are issued on a specific issue date and are often purchased on a later settlement date.\n",

    "There are various types of bonds, each with unique features. Government bonds are issued by national governments and are generally considered low-risk. Corporate bonds are issued by companies and may offer higher yields to compensate for higher risk. Municipal bonds are issued by local governments and may provide tax advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount and pay the full face value at maturity. Coupon bonds pay regular interest, while callable bonds can be redeemed by the issuer before maturity. Putable bonds allow the holder to force the issuer to repurchase the bond before maturity. Convertible bonds can be exchanged for a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bond cash flow patterns vary. Level coupon bonds pay fixed interest at regular intervals. Amortizing bonds pay both interest and part of the principal over time, reducing the outstanding balance. Perpetual bonds pay interest indefinitely and have no maturity date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bond prices are quoted using different conventions. The clean price excludes accrued interest, while the dirty price includes it. Accrued interest is the interest earned since the last payment but not yet paid to the bondholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yield concepts are fundamental to understanding bond returns. The current yield is calculated as the annual coupon divided by the current price. Yield to maturity (YTM) represents the total return anticipated if the bond is held until maturity, taking into account all coupon payments and the difference between the purchase price and face value."

    "\n",
    "Goverment bonds are typically issued in US Dollars, Euros or local currency. While local currency debt can be inflated away by printing money, foreign currency debt is considered safer by investors. Sometimes investors also demand additional protections such as issuing bonds in a different legal jurisdiction, such as New York or London. There is no international law governing these bonds, or equitization, therefore when a country defaults, investors must negotiate directly with the government on a haircut. While the government has an incentive to reduce the repayment amount, countries must deal with reputational concerns for borrowing in the future if investors are unsatisfied with the renegotiation outcome. Here are examples of how much different countries pay to borrow money for 10 years: \n",
