    "Money market instruments (MMIs) are short-term debt securities, typically maturing in less than one year, used for liquidity management and low-risk investing. Examples include Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper, Certificates of Deposit, and Bankers’ Acceptances. Bonds, on the other hand, are long-term debt instruments with maturities often exceeding one year, paying periodic interest (coupons) and primarily used for long-term financing or investment. While MMIs prioritize safety and liquidity, bonds balance income potential with interest rate and credit risk.\n",

    "Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are short-term government securities, typically issued with maturities ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. They are sold at a discount to their face value and redeemed at par, so investors earn a return from the difference between purchase price and face value rather than periodic interest payments. T-Bills are highly liquid and considered very low-risk, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. They are commonly used for short-term cash management by investors, corporations, and governments. Additionally, in many countries, the interest income from T-Bills is exempt from state and local taxes, making them a safe and tax-efficient investment."

    "Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short- to medium-term time deposits issued by banks that pay a fixed interest rate over a specified period. Unlike Treasury Bills, CDs do pay interest (coupon) periodically or at maturity, depending on the terms. They are considered low-risk investments, typically insured up to certain limits in many countries, and are sold at face value rather than at a discount. The investor agrees to leave the funds deposited for a fixed term, and early withdrawal may result in penalties. CDs can have different maturities, ranging from a few weeks to several years, and their yield depends on the interest rate environment and the issuing bank’s creditworthiness."
