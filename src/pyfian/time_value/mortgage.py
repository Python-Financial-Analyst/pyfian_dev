    r"""
    Calculate the fixed payment per payment period for a mortgage.

    This function computes the payment amount due each payment period given
    the principal, annual interest rate, total loan term in months, and the
    interval between payments in months.

    The formula used is:

    .. math::
        PMT = \frac{P \cdot r}{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{N}}}
    where:
        - :math:`PMT` is the payment amount per period
        - :math:`P` is the principal loan amount
        - :math:`r` is the periodic interest rate. This is calculated as the annual rate
        divided by the number of payments per year.
        - :math:`N` is the total number of payments
    This function handles cases where the payment interval is not monthly,
    adjusting the interest rate and number of payments accordingly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    principal : float
        The original loan amount.
    annual_rate : float
        The annual nominal interest rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.04 for 4%).
    term_months : int
        The total loan term expressed in months.
    payment_interval_months : int, optional
        The number of months between payments (default is 1 for monthly payments).
        If None, defaults to 1 (monthly payments).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The fixed payment amount due each payment period.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If payment_interval_months is zero or negative, or if total_payments is zero.

    --------

    Calculate mortgage cash flows (amortization schedule).

    This function generates a DataFrame containing the amortization schedule
    for a mortgage loan, including the payment amount, interest, principal,

    The schedule is generated using the `generate_amortization_schedule` function,
    which calculates the fixed payment per period and breaks down each payment
    into interest and principal components.

    Parameters
    ----------
    principal : float
        The loan principal amount.
    annual_rate : float
        Annual nominal interest rate (decimal).
    term_months : int
        Loan term in months.
    payment_interval_months : int, optional
        Months between payments (default is 1 = monthly, 3 = quarterly).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Amortization schedule with Period, Payment, Interest,
        Principal, and Remaining Balance.
